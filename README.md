# Weather Forecasting Model

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for weather forecasting using historical weather data. The model predicts weather conditions based on various meteorological factors, enabling accurate short-term and long-term forecasts.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes historical weather data from NOAA.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses data to handle missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
- **Model Selection**: Implements a Ridge Regression model.
- **Model Training**: Trains the selected model on historical data to learn patterns and correlations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Forecasting**: Generates weather forecasts based on real-time or simulated input data.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes forecasted weather patterns and model performance metrics using plots and charts.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis
